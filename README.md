# Machine Learning Tasks using Hugging Face Models

This repository contains a collection of machine learning tasks implemented using Hugging Face models. The tasks demonstrate the capabilities of state-of-the-art models in various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Below is an overview of the tasks included in this repository:

## Tasks

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Analyze the sentiment of text data, determining whether the expressed opinion is positive, negative, or neutral.

### 2. Text Classification
Classify text into predefined categories, enabling automated sorting and organization of large text datasets.

### 3. Image Classification
Classify images into different categories, leveraging powerful models to recognize and categorize visual content accurately.

### 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identify and classify named entities (such as people, organizations, locations) within text, enhancing the understanding of textual data.

### 5. Object Detection
Detect and localize objects within images, providing bounding boxes and labels for each detected object.

### 6. Text Summarization
Generate concise and coherent summaries from longer text documents, aiding in quick information extraction.

### 7. Question Answering
Answer questions based on given context passages, showcasing the ability to understand and retrieve information from text.

## Models and Libraries
